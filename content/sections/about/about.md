I'm <u>Mai (Tiêu Khởi Mai)</u>

A data gal, a master student and another (an amateur writer, maybe). 

And this is my /maɪ/ blog. The world is a messy place but at least now I have a way of structuring queries about it. And let me share with you my own story or all I known about my career - technical and non-technical in the most naive way.
